# Members Only project

This is an app which allows users to sign up for an account to post messages to a message board. Users who are able to provide the password for member status are able to see the author of each post, as well as the date that it was written. Users can also provide an admin password in order to have the option to delete messages.

Built using Express, NodeJS, Passport, Bcrypt, Mongoose and Pug.
